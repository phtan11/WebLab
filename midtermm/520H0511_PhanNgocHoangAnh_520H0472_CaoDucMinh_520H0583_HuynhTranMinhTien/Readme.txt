Steps to run a web application
- First, you need to install NodeJS with NPM (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- In folder "server"
    + Open command line, and run "npm install" to install the necessary packages
    + After installing the package, type the command "npm start" to run the server with port 8080
    + The server will be running so you can send rest api to localhost:8080 and the database configured in the .env file is connected to the MongoDB cloud
- In folder "client"
    + Open command line, and run "npm install" to install the necessary packages
    + After installing the package, type the command "npm start" to run the website with port 3000
    + You can access localhost:3000 to use the website
* Note: The website runs on port 3000 and the server runs on port 8080, so if your machine is running an application that coincides with the two ports above, please turn it off so that the website can work properly.
